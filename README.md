A package to work with interval regression and ordered logit and probit models

:warning: `oglm` is a personal adaptation of `oglmx` :package: available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/oglmx/index.html). Because the
:package: does not look actively maintened and I needed a few enhancement, I 
started to work on the source code

## Installation

You can install the github version of `oglm` with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("linogaliana/oglm")
```

* `predict` method
* ...
